abstract = {A hospital‐based case‐control study of matched pairs was conducted to explore (a) the relationship between the use of betel quid chewing, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking and oral cancer and (b) synergism between these factors. The case group consisted of 104 male and 3 female oral cancer patients and these were compared with 194 male and 6 female matched controls. We found by univariate analysis that alcohol consumption, smoking, betel quid chewing, educational level and occupation were associated with oral cancer. The adjusted odds ratios were to be found elevated in patients who were smoking and betel quid chewing. After adjusting for education and occupation covariates, the incidence of oral cancer was computed to be 123‐fold higher in patients who smoked, drank alcohol and chewed betel quid than in obstainers. The synergistic effects of alcohol, tobacco smoke and betel quid in oral cancer were clearly demonstrated, but there was a statistically significant association between oral cancer and betel quid chewing alone. Swallowing betel quid juice (saliva extract of betel quid produced by chewing) or including unripened betel fruit in the quid both seemed to enhance the risks of contracting oral cancer.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate whether there is evidence of field cancerization in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) enrolled in a betel quid chewing area. We also assessed whether betel quid chewing is an independent risk factor for field cancerization in OSCC patients. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the records of 1570 OSCC patients who underwent radical tumor resection between 1996 and 2011. A total of 1243 study participants (79{\%}) had a positive history of betel quid chewing before surgery. Of the 767 patients treated with surgery alone, 599 (78{\%}) were preoperative chewers, whereas a history of preoperative betel quid chewing was identified in 644 (80{\%}) of the 803 patients who received adjuvant therapy. The 5-year control, survival, and second primary tumors (SPTs) rates served as the main outcome measures. RESULTS: Regardless of the treatment modality, more than 70{\%} of the SPTs were located in the oral cavity or soft palate. Despite a similar risk profile in terms of tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, and pathological margin status, preoperative chewers showed a significantly higher incidence of 5-year SPTs and local recurrences compared with non-chewers. Moreover, multivariate analysis demonstrated that preoperative betel quid chewing was an independent prognostic factor for 5-year local control and SPTs occurrence rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that preoperative betel quid chewers had a higher incidence of local recurrence and SPTs than non-chewers, suggesting that field cancerization may occur in OSCC patients with a history of betel quid chewing.},

abstract = {Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is considered as a pre-cancerous condition of the oral  mucosa and is highly associated with habitual areca quid chewing. Arecoline is the major alkaloid in areca quid and is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of OSF. Our previous studies have demonstrated that arecoline could induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related factors in primary human buccal mucosal fibroblasts (BMFs). Therefore, we investigated the expression of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), which is a well-known transcriptional factor in EMT, in OSF tissues and its role in arecoline-induced myofibroblast transdifferentiation from BMFs. The expression of ZEB1, as well as the myofibroblast marker $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin ($\alpha$-SMA), was significantly increased in OSF tissues, respectively. With immunofluorescence analysis, arecoline induced the formation of $\alpha$-SMA-positive stress fibres in BMFs expressing nuclear ZEB1. Arecoline also induced collagen contraction of BMFs in vitro. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, the binding of ZEB1 to the $\alpha$-SMA promoter in BMFs was increased by arecoline. The promoter activity of $\alpha$-SMA in BMFs was also induced by arecoline, while knockdown of ZEB1 abolished arecoline-induced $\alpha$-SMA promoter activity and collagen contraction of BMFs. Long-term exposure of BMFs to arecoline induced the expression of fibrogenic genes and ZEB1. Silencing of ZEB1 in fibrotic BMFs from an OSF patient also suppressed the expression of $\alpha$-SMA and myofibroblast activity. Inhibition of insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 could suppress arecoline-induced ZEB1 activation in BMFs. Our data suggest that ZEB1 may participate in the pathogenesis of areca quid-associated OSF by activating the $\alpha$-SMA promoter and inducing myofibroblast transdifferentiation from BMFs.},

abstract = {J Oral Pathol Med (2011) 40: 208–213 Background: Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is a chronic debilitating disease and a premalignant condition of the oral cavity characterized by generalized submucosal fibrosis. Myofibroblasts are contractile cells expressing $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin ($\alpha$-SMA) and are considered primary producers of extracellular matrix after injury. Their accumulation has been established as a marker of progressive fibrosis in organs like lungs, liver, kidney and skin. This study aims to evaluate the presence of myofibroblasts in various histological stages of OSMF. Materials and Method: Seventy cases of OSMF, which were further categorized histologically into early (35 cases) and advanced (35 cases), were subjected to immunohistochemistry using $\alpha$-SMA antibody for detection of myofibroblasts. Fifteen normal oral mucosa specimens were also stained as controls. Results: The number of $\alpha$-SMA-stained myofibroblasts in OSMF was significantly increased when compared to that of the normal controls (P {\textless} 0.001). Additionally, a statistically significant increase in the myofibroblasts population between early and advanced stages was observed (P = 0.000). Conclusions: Our results corroborate the possibility that OSMF actually represents an abnormal healing process in response to chronic mechanical and chemical irritation because of areca nut chewing as demonstrated by the increased incidence of myofibroblasts in this disease. Furthermore, the progressive increase in myofibroblasts from early to advanced stages suggests their potential use as markers for evaluating the severity of OSMF.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Lymph node metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a poor prognostic factor. The histopathologic stage (e.g., pN) is used to evaluate the severity of lymph node metastasis; however, the current staging system insufficiently predicts survival and recurrence. We investigated clinical outcomes and lymph node density (LND) in betel nut-chewing individuals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 389 betel nut-exposed patients with primary OSCC who underwent surgical resection in 2002-2015. The prognostic significance of LND was evaluated by overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that the 5-year OS and DFS rates in all patients were 60.9 and 48.9{\%}, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that variables independently prognostic for OS were aged population (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.6, 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI] = 1.1-2.5; P = .025), and cell differentiation classification (HR = 2.4, 95{\%} CI = 1.4-4.2; P = .002). In pathologic N-positive patients, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for OS was used and indicated the best cutoff of 0.05, and the multivariate analysis showed that LND was an independent predictor of OS (HR = 2.2, 95{\%} CI = 1.3-3.7; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Lymph node density, at a cutoff of 0.05, was an independent predictor of OS and DFS. OS and DFS underwent multiple analyses, and LND remained significant. The pathologic N stage had no influence in the OS analysis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: LND is a more reliable predictor of survival in betel nut-chewing patients for further post operation adjuvant treatment, such as reoperation or adjuvant radiotherapy.},

abstract = {Background: The transgenerational metabolic effects of betel-quid chewing have been reported in mice but not in humans. Objective: This study aimed to determine whether exposure to paternal chewing of betel nut quids led to an increased risk of early manifestation of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in human offspring. Design: The subjects were selected from 66 971 residents aged {\textgreater} 19 y who attended a community-based Integrated Screening Program in Taiwan and who were identified as parent-child trios (n = 5037). Using a population-based, parent-child study design, we compared the mean ages of offspring with MetS at entry between those who were exposed and those who were unexposed to paternal chewing of quids containing betel nut. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and to assess dose-response relations for paternal betel-quid exposure. Results: The offspring who were exposed to paternal betel-quid chewing were younger than those who were not exposed, regardless of MetS status; they also had a 2.14-fold increase in the risk of early manifestation of MetS (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.14; 95{\%} CI: 1.25, 3.66) after control for environmental and other risk factors, including personal betel chewing. Significant dose-response relations were found between the risk of early MetS and the quantity and duration of paternal exposure to betel quids. In the absence of MetS in either parent and of betel-quid consumption by the offspring, paternal exposure to betel quids increased the risk of early manifestation of MetS in offspring 2.53-fold (95{\%} CI: 1.03, 2.64) compared with paternal nonexposure. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that exposure to paternal betel-quid chewing increases the risk of early manifestation of MetS in human offspring in a dose-dependent manner.},

abstract = {Betel-quid chewing is an ancient and socially accepted practice. The introduction of tobacco reinforced this practice, and now almost all habitual chewers of betel quids include tobacco. It is well established that chewing of betel quid with tobacco causes oral cancer and is largely responsible for the high incidence of oral cancer in several South Asian countries. The feasibility of primary prevention of oral cancer was studied in a population-based prospective intervention study. A cohort of 12,212 betel-quid chewers and smokers was exposed to a programme of health education for stopping chewing and smoking and subjected to annual examinations for detection of oral precancerous lesions. Evaluations after one, five and eight years showed that primary prevention of oral cancer is feasible and practicable. Early detection of oral cancer is an important control measure. In a secondary prevention study, 53 basic health workers were trained in the detection and referral of lesions suspected of being oral cancer. Over one year, they examined more than 39,000 high-risk individuals, resulting in the detection of 20 cases of oral cancer. The sensitivity and specificity of their diagnoses was assessed through a re-examination of a 5{\%} sample: we concluded that it was possible to incorporate a secondary prevention programme into the existing health care system.},

Methods: Twenty-five patients were enrolled in the study from 2004 to 2008, of whom 13 received first-line cetuximab plus chemotherapy and 12 received second-line cetuximab with or without chemotherapy after the failure of cisplatin. Results: In the first-line chemotherapy group, the overall response [complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR)] was 54{\%} and disease control rate [CR + PR + stable disease (SD)] was 62{\%}. In the cisplatin-failure therapy group, the overall response was 16.7{\%} and disease control rate was 50{\%}. Median overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) in the first-line chemotherapy group were 857 days and 147 days, respectively. In the cisplatin-failure therapy group, median OS and TTP were 371 days and 136 days, respectively. The most common grade 3/4 toxicity in both groups of patients was infection/fever (23{\%} in the first-line group, 50{\%} in the cisplatin-failure group), followed by neutropenia (23{\%} in the first-line group, 25{\%} in the cisplatin-failure group).

abstract = {Neoplasms of diverse cellular origin arise in the oral cavity and among these oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) arising from the mucosa of the oral cavity constitutes to over 90{\%}1, 2. Oral cancer encompasses all the malignancies originating in the oral tissues, including cancers of the lip, tongue, gingiva, floor of the mouth, buccal mucosa, palate and the retromolar trigone. It is the 6th most common cancer worldwide3. Oral squamous cell carcinoma is described as an invasive epithelial neoplasm with varying degrees of squamous differentiation and a propensity to early and extensive lymph node metastases, occurring predominantly in alcohol and tobacco using adults generally in the 5th and 6th decades of life. Globally about 5, 00,000 new cases of oral and oropharyngeal cancers are diagnosed and three quarters of these are from the developing world7, 8, 9. Approximately 3, 89,650 cases occurred in the year 2000 out of which 2, 66,672 were in the oral cavity (ICD – 9 140 – 5) and 1, 22,978 for the cancer of oropharynx (ICD – 9 146, 8-9). This represented about 5{\%} of all cancers for men and 2{\%} for women10. Oral and oropharyngeal cancers remain one of the more common cancers in the South and South East Asian countries, as opposed to Western society, where it accounts for only about 1 – 4{\%} of the of reported cancers incidence 4. For example, the incidence of oral cancer in India is high, constituting about 12{\%} of all cancer in men and 8{\%} in women5; mortality rate is equally high in this population, ranking number one in men and number three in women6. Oral and oropharyngeal cancers therefore qualify as major public health problem, not only in India, but also globally. Worldwide, oral cancer incidence rates appear to have been stabilizing over the last decade12, but the greater frequency of oral cancer in certain regions and among specific populations is a cause for concern since their overall 5-year survival rate is 53{\%} and it has not changed in the last two decades13. With this heightened awareness, research to further investigate the detection, diagnosis and prevention or oral cancer has recently been included as one of the targeted priorities supported by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDR) in the United States14.},

abstract = {Tobacco, betel quid, and alcohol are established risk factors for oral cavity cancer that have been known for decades. Tobacco exposure includes smoking cigarettes, cigars, pipes, bidis, chewing tobacco, and using snuff. An association of involuntary smoking with oral cavity cancer is not established, though evidence on such an association exists for lung cancer. Few studies have focused on assessment of the carcinogenicity of involuntary smoking specifically for oral cavity cancer, and it is a difficult exposure to measure. There are no studies on e-cigarettes or smoking of waterpipes and the risk of oral cavity cancer. Studies of oral cavity cancer for these forms of tobacco smoking would be of interest as a future direction of research. Both case-control and cohort studies support the independent effect of alcohol drinking on risk of oral cavity cancer, with strong dose-response relationships measured by frequency or duration of alcohol drinking. Betel quid with or without tobacco is also confirmed to be carcinogenic. Cessation of alcohol drinking reduces risks, with risks returning to those of never drinkers after 10 years. All types of alcoholic beverages confer an excess oral cavity cancer risk.},

In this study, we used PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing to analyze the conserved regions of the p53 gene (exons 5-9) in OSCC tumor specimens from 187 patients with varied histories of betel quid, tobacco and alcohol use. Ninety-one of the 187 OSCCs (48.66{\%}) showed p53 gene mutations at exons 5-9. The incidence of p53 mutations was not associated with age, sex, TNM stage, status of cigarette smoking or betel quid chewing. However, alcohol drinkers exhibited a significantly higher incidence (57/101, 56.44{\%}) of p53 mutations than non-users (39.53{\%}, 34/86) (P = 0.02). The effect of alcohol on the incidence of p53 mutations was still statistically significant (RR = 2.24; 95{\%} CI, 1.21-4.15) after adjustment for cigarette smoking and betel quid (BQ) chewing. G:C to A:T transitions were the predominant mutations observed and associated with BQ and tobacco use. Alcohol drinking could enhance these transitions. After adjustment for cigarette smoking and BQ chewing, alcohol drinking still showed an independent effect on G:C to A:T transitions (RR = 2.41; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-5.74). These findings strongly suggest an important contributive role of tobacco carcinogens to p53 mutation in this series of Taiwanese OSCCs and alcohol might enhance these mutagenic effects. As safrole-DNA adducts have been detected in 77{\%} (23/30) of the OSCC tissues from Taiwanese oral cancer patients with a BQ chewing history, we cannot rule out the possibility that safrole or other carcinogens present in the BQ may cause a similar pattern of mutagenesis. Determination of the role of safrole and other carcinogens present in BQ on the pattern of p53 gene mutation in OSCC will require further study.},

abstract = {A hospital‐based case‐control study of matched pairs was conducted to explore (a) the relationship between the use of betel quid chewing, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking and oral cancer and (b) synergism between these factors. The case group consisted of 104 male and 3 female oral cancer patients and these were compared with 194 male and 6 female matched controls. We found by univariate analysis that alcohol consumption, smoking, betel quid chewing, educational level and occupation were associated with oral cancer. The adjusted odds ratios were to be found elevated in patients who were smoking and betel quid chewing. After adjusting for education and occupation covariates, the incidence of oral cancer was computed to be 123‐fold higher in patients who smoked, drank alcohol and chewed betel quid than in obstainers. The synergistic effects of alcohol, tobacco smoke and betel quid in oral cancer were clearly demonstrated, but there was a statistically significant association between oral cancer and betel quid chewing alone. Swallowing betel quid juice (saliva extract of betel quid produced by chewing) or including unripened betel fruit in the quid both seemed to enhance the risks of contracting oral cancer.

abstract = {Background. This study investigated the association between betel nut chewing and  subclinical ischemic heart disease (IHD) in Taiwanese type 2 diabetic patients. Methods. A total of 394 male patients aging ≥45 years and without previous heart disease were studied. Among them 349 had no habit of chewing betel nut and 45 possessed the habit for ≥5 years. Subclinical IHD was diagnosed by a Minnesota-coded resting electrocardiogram and was present in 71 cases. Statistical analyses were performed considering confounding effects of age, diabetic duration, smoking, body mass index, blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and metabolic control status. Results. Betel nut chewers were younger and had higher prevalence of smoking (86.7{\%} versus 60.5{\%}), higher body mass index, poorer glycemic control, and higher prevalence of subclinical IHD (28.9{\%} versus 16.6{\%}). Patients with subclinical IHD were older and had higher prevalence of betel nut chewing (18.0{\%} versus 9.9{\%}). The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio for subclinical IHD for chewers versus nonchewers was 4.640 (1.958-10.999). The adjusted odds ratios in younger or older patients divided by the median age of 63 years were similar: 4.724 (1.346-16.581) and 4.666 (1.278-17.028), respectively. Conclusions. Betel nut chewing is significantly associated with increased risk of subclinical IHD.},

abstract = {Betel-quid and areca-nut chewing - a traditional habit widely practiced in many parts of Asia - is also popular among immigrants resident in the United Kingdom, other parts of Europe, North America and Australia. An international working group of scientific experts convened by the Monographs Programme of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the World Health Organization, has reviewed the published studies related to cancer and chewing betel quid and areca nut. A previous evaluation in 1985 had found that chewing betel quid with tobacco is carcinogenic to humans. The new evaluation goes further to conclude that chewing betel quid without tobacco is also carcinogenic to humans. The working group also concluded that the areca nut, a common component of many different chewing habits, is carcinogenic to humans. A WIDESPREAD HABIT Betel quid generally consists of betel leaf (from the Piper betle vine), areca nut (from the Areca catechu tree), and slaked lime (predominantly calcium hydroxide), to which tobacco is often added. Other ingredients and flavouring agents can be included according to local preferences and practices. Betel-quid and areca-nut chewing are widely practiced in many parts of Asia and in Asian-migrant communities elsewhere in the world, with hundreds of millions of users worldwide. Betel quid is chewed for many reasons, including for its stimulant effects, to satisfy hunger, to sweeten the breath, and as a social and cultural practice. Traditional as well as commercially packaged products are now freely available in pan shops in many cities outside Asia. The United Kingdom is the number one importing country outside of Asia, with imports having doubled since the early 80's. In some immigrant communities a large majority is using these products. Young children start using sweetened areca-nut products, often adding tobacco later in their adolescence. A CANCER-CAUSING HABIT The expert working group has determined that betel quid with tobacco causes oral cancer, cancer of the pharynx, and cancer of the oesophagus in humans. Betel quid without tobacco is now known to cause oral cancer in humans. Areca nut, a common component of all betel quid preparations, has been observed to cause oral submucous fibrosis (a pre-cancerous condition that can progress to malignant oral cancer), leading to the determination that areca nut itself is carcinogenic to humans. Studies among Asian migrant communities have demonstrated a significantly higher risk for oral cancer compared with natives of countries where they have settled. The new evaluation of betel quid without tobacco was made possible by recent epidemiologic studies from parts of the world where tobacco generally is not added to the betel quid. In addition, recent epidemiologic studies in South Asia have been able to separate the effects of betel quid use with and without tobacco. Oral cancers are more common in parts of the world where betel quid is chewed. Of the 390,000 oral and oro-pharyngeal cancers estimated to occur annually in the world, 228,000 (58{\%}) occur in South and South-East Asia. In some parts of India, oral cancer is the most common cancer. Striking evidence has emerged from Taiwan, China, where the incidence of oral cancer in men has tripled since the early 1980s, coinciding with a steep rise since the early 1970s and predominantly among men, in the practice of chewing betel quid. Tobacco generally is not added to the betel quid in that region. A NEW CAUSE FOR CONCERN In recent years, a variety of mass-produced, pre-packaged areca-nut products have become available in many countries around the world. Aggressive advertising, targeted at the middle class and at children, has enhanced the sales and use of these products. In some parts of India, almost one out of three children and teenagers regularly or occasionally chew these products. Some have viewed such products without tobacco (for example, pan masala) as a safe alternative to betel quid with tobacco. The evidence shows that these products have led to oral disease, even among children, and that use of these products cannot be considered safe. Several states in India have begun to regulate these products, and reductions in oral disease and oral cancer can be expected to follow from reductions in their use. THE IARC MONOGRAPHS The IARC Monographs Programme publishes authoritative, independent evaluations of carcinogenic risks to humans caused by a variety of agents, mixtures and exposures. Each evaluation is the product of deliberations by an international working group of scientific experts. Since its inception in 1971, the series has evaluated nearly 900 agents, and the IARC Monographs have become known for their thoroughness, accuracy, and integrity.

abstract = {We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis of 50 publications assessing the relationship between oral/oropharyngeal cancer and chewing betel quid, with (BQ+T) or without added tobacco (BQ-T), a common practice in many parts of Asia and globally among Asian immigrants. Exposure-response, by daily amount and years of BQ chewed, was assessed using spline models. Attributable fractions (PAF{\%}) were calculated to estimate the public health impact if BQ were no longer chewed. The meta-relative risk (mRR) for oral/oropharyngeal cancer in the Indian subcontinent was 2.56 (95{\%}CI, 2.00-3.28; 15 studies) for BQ-T and 7.74 (95{\%}CI, 5.38-11.13; 31 studies) for BQ+T; in Taiwan, China, the mRR for BQ-T was 10.98 (95{\%}CI, 4.86-24.84; 13 studies). Restricting to studies that adjusted for tobacco and alcohol use had only a small effect on the risk estimates. For BQ+T in the Indian subcontinent, the mRR was much higher in women (mRR, 14.56; 95{\%}CI, 7.63-27.76) than in men. Exposure-response analyses showed that the risk of oral/oropharyngeal cancer increased with increasing daily amount and duration (years) of chewing BQ in India and Taiwan, China. Roughly half of oral cancers in these countries could be prevented if BQ were no longer chewed (PAF{\%}=53.7{\%} for BQ-T in Taiwan, China; PAF{\%}=49.5{\%} for BQ+T in India). We demonstrate that betel quid chewing, with or without added tobacco, increases the risk of oral/oropharyngeal cancer in an exposure-dependent manner, independently of tobacco and alcohol use. Further work is needed to explain the higher risks associated with chewing BQ-T in Taiwan, China. What's new? Betel quid is commonly chewed in many parts of Asia and globally by migrants of Asian descent, making it a major risk factor for oral cancer in those populations. This study demonstrates that chewing betel quid, with or without added tobacco, increases the risk of oral and oropharyngeal cancer in a dose-response manner. The results summarize and quantify the impact of betel quid chewing on oral and oropharyngeal cancer by gender and subsite. This risk evaluation may aid public health prevention efforts, particularly on the Indian subcontinent and in Taiwan, China. {\textcopyright} 2013 UICC.},

abstract = {Aim: This historical medical literature review aims at understanding the evolution of the medical existence of oral cancer over times, particularly better comprehending if the apparent lower prevalence of this type of cancer in antiquity is a real value due to the absence of modern environmental and lifestyle factors or it is linked to a misinterpretation of ancient foreign terms found in ancient medical texts regarding oral neoplasms. Methods: The databases MedLne, PubMed, Web of Science, Elsevier's EMBASE.com, Cochrane Review, National Library of Greece (Stavros Niarchos Foundation, Athens) and the Library of the School of Health Sciences of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (Greece) were extensively searched for relevant studies published during the past century on the history of oral cancer and its treatment from antiquity to modern times, in addition to the WHO website to analyse the latest epidemiological data. In addition, we included historical books on the topic of interest and original sources. Results: Historical references reveal that the cradle of the oral oncology was in ancient Egypt, the Asian continent and Greece and cancer management was confined to an approximate surgical practice, in order to remove abnormal masses and avoid bleeding with cauterization. In the Medieval Age, little progress occurred in medicine in general, oral cancers management included. It is only from the Renaissance to modern times that knowledge about its pathophysiological mechanisms and histopathology and its surgical and pharmacological treatment approaches became increasingly deep all over the world, evolving to the actual integrated treatment. Despite the abundant literature exploring oncology in past civilizations, the real prevalence of oral cancer in antiquity is much less known; but a literature analysis cannot exclude a consistent prevalence of this cancer in past populations, probably with a likely lower incidence than today, because many descriptions of its aggressiveness were found in ancient medical texts, but it is still difficult to be sure that each single description of oral masses could be associated to cancer, particularly for what concerns the period before the Middle Ages. Conclusions: Modern oncologists and oral surgeons must learn a lot from their historic counterparts in order to avoid past unsuccessful efforts to treatment oral malignancies. Several descriptions of oral cancers in the antiquity that we found let us think that this disease might be linked to mechanisms not strictly dependent on environmental risk factors, and this might guide future research on oral cavity treatments towards strategical cellular and molecular techniques.},

Furthermore, cancer staging, with or without bony invasion, can be complicated during tooth eruption. Literature on pediatric oral cancers is lacking, making determination of the possible etiopathology difficult. We describe an exceptional case of a 5-year-old male child who presented with anterior maxillary gingival pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia that progressed to carcinoma cuniculatum with invasive oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Because of the interesting timing of events, we hypothesize that human papillomavirus (HPV) inoculation through cutaneous squamous papilloma played a contributory role. A review of similar case reports in the literature is included. Biopsy of suspicious oral lesions should not be delayed because of the young age of the patient. Atypical hyperplasia should include squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the differential diagnoses.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Betel quid (BQ) components induce the secretion of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) in oral keratinocytes, which promotes oral mucosal inflammation and oral cancer. This study was carried out to evaluate the association of TNFA genetic variants (-308G{\textgreater}A and -238G{\textgreater}A) with the risk and prognosis of BQ-related oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).

DESIGN: A total of 403 subjects (205 cancer cases and 198 healthy controls) who habitually chewed BQ were recruited. The genotypes were determined by TaqMan real-time assays.

RESULTS: G allele and G/G genotype at TNFA -308 were associated with a 1.95-fold (95{\%}CI: 1.16-3.28, p(corrected)=0.024) and 2.28-fold (95{\%}CI: 1.30-4.00, p(corrected)=0.008) increased risk of cancer as compared to those with A allele or A/A+A/G genotypes, respectively. In addition, G allele (p=0.080) and G/G genotype (p=0.076) at TNFA -238 were associated with a borderline but statistically significant increased risk of OPSCC. The combined G/G+G/G genotype at both loci had a 2.37-fold increased risk of OPSCC as compared to those with other combined genotypes (95{\%}CI: 1.41-4.00, p=0.001). Interactions between combined genotypes and smoking status were also found to contribute to risk of BQ-related OPSCC. There was no association of TNFA genotypes with clinicopathologic findings or the survival of OPSCC patients.

CONCLUSIONS: BQ-chewers who carry the G allele or G/G genotype in TNFA -308 may have an increased risk of OPSCC. The intensity of cigarette smoking modulates the effect of the combined TNFA genotypes on risk of BQ-related OPSCC.},

abstract = {Objective Betel quid (BQ) components induce the secretion of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) in oral keratinocytes, which promotes oral mucosal inflammation and oral cancer. This study was carried out to evaluate the association of TNFA genetic variants (−308G{\textgreater}A and −238G{\textgreater}A) with the risk and prognosis of BQ-related oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Design A total of 403 subjects (205 cancer cases and 198 healthy controls) who habitually chewed BQ were recruited. The genotypes were determined by TaqMan real-time assays. Results G allele and G/G genotype at TNFA −308 were associated with a 1.95-fold (95{\%}CI: 1.16–3.28, pcorrected = 0.024) and 2.28-fold (95{\%}CI: 1.30–4.00, pcorrected = 0.008) increased risk of cancer as compared to those with A allele or A/A + A/G genotypes, respectively. In addition, G allele (p = 0.080) and G/G genotype (p = 0.076) at TNFA −238 were associated with a borderline but statistically significant increased risk of OPSCC. The combined G/G + G/G genotype at both loci had a 2.37-fold increased risk of OPSCC as compared to those with other combined genotypes (95{\%}CI: 1.41–4.00, p = 0.001). Interactions between combined genotypes and smoking status were also found to contribute to risk of BQ-related OPSCC. There was no association of TNFA genotypes with clinicopathologic findings or the survival of OPSCC patients. Conclusions BQ-chewers who carry the G allele or G/G genotype in TNFA −308 may have an increased risk of OPSCC. The intensity of cigarette smoking modulates the effect of the combined TNFA genotypes on risk of BQ-related OPSCC.

={\textgreater} 2.1. Study subjects
In this study, 403 male subjects who habitually chewed BQ were recruited: 205 OPSCC case patients and 198 healthy controls. Case patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated, and pathologically confirmed primary OPSCC (of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and hypopharynx) were recruited between January 2004 and November 2007 from the Department of ENT and Dentistry at Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital (KSVGH). Case patients with complete follow up (195, 95.12{\%}) and annual reviews of medical records entered the survival analysis.

The 198 healthy controls were recruited from the oral health screen clinic at the Department of Otolaryngology, KSVGH and from the oral health screen campaigns for vehicle drivers, cleaners, and hardware workers held by the Kaohsiung city government or Department of Otolaryngology, KSVGH between 2004 and 2007. The selection criteria for controls included the absence of history of cancer and oral precancerous lesions, and negative screening for oral precancerous lesions. Controls were frequency-matched to case patients on age (±5 years), ethnicity, and years of BQ chewing.

After signing an informed consent, each subject was interviewed using a structured questionnaire that elicited detailed information on the history of betel quid chewing, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking habits, and the general demographic data. At the end of the interview, each subject donated 7–15 ml of blood in an EDTA tube according to the protocol that had been approved by the Institutional Review Board of KSVGH.},

@article{Petti2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alcohol drinking is associated with high oral cancer (OC) risk. This  association is particularly evident in tobacco smoking/betel quid (BQ) chewing subjects. In a previous stratified meta-analysis (Petti S et al., Cancer Epidemiol 2012) we reported that drinking was inversely associated with OC in non-smoking BQ non-chewing individuals, while this association was reversed in smoking individuals. However, the previous study could be excessively influenced by a large primary study, which yielded more than 50{\%} of the weight of all the primary studies. Therefore, we updated this analysis using only recent studies. METHODS: Case-control studies published between 2010 and 2012 were searched. In each study, non-smoking/ BQ non-chewing exposed (ever routine drinkers) and unexposed (never drinkers) subjects with (cases)/without (controls) OC were extracted and odds ratio (OR) calculated. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed with Cochran's Q. Publication bias was formally assessed with trim and fill method. Sensitivity analysis to inclusion criteria was made. The pooled OR was assessed with the fixed- and random-effect methods and corrected for publication bias. RESULTS: Seven of these studies met the inclusion criteria: they were not heterogeneous enough. Correction for publication bias was not necessary and provided only one missing study. The OR estimates were 0.70 (95{\%} confidence interval -95CI, 0.51-0.98), 0.70 (95CI, 0.51-0.96), 0.75 (95CI, 0.54-1.03) with the three methods. Sensitivity analysis did not change the OR estimates considerably. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis corroborated the results of the previous analysis, confirming that drinking was inversely associated with OC in non-smoking, BQ non-chewing subjects.},
